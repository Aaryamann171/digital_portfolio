# Hello There ðŸ‘‹
I am currently in my final year of Computer Science Engineering, specializing in Artificial intelligence. I am interested in discovering what is possible with programming and what the future has in store for us. I am a result driven, tech enthusiast.
Along with my studies I like to play around with various technologies and frameworks. I am fan of clean and simple design and focus on function over form. I like collabrate with like minded people and create great products which add value to the life of people around me.
